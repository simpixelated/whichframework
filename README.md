Which JavaScript framework should I learn?
==============

To quote The Rock, it doesn't matter!!

>The challenge is that when presented with an abundance of choice, you can feel increasingly unsure of whether yours is the right one. Instead of being happy with our decisions, we’re filled with anxiety. Did I pick the wrong one? Would I have been better off with something else? What would my friends have used? Should I ask them? I don’t want to seem stupid. We’re stuck in a rut pondering whether we’ve missed an opportunity for something better. How many times have you second-guessed your technology stack?

>When you’re given too much choice you can also end up increasing your expectations. Maybe you feel that if you hold out, you’ll find the ‘best’ one. The unicorn in the herd. Clearly, with so many options to choose from, the correct choice must be amazing. Often, however, on discovery of what the ‘correct’ choice is like we can feel unfulfilled. Such high expectations are difficult to meet, leaving us in a state of unquenchable dissatisfaction.

>JavaScript has “Yet another framework syndrome” (how many solutions do we have for MVC, template rendering or data-binding?)
